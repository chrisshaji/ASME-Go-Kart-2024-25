# ASME-Go-Kart-2024-25
This was a very fun project where I got to work on creating a drivable Go-kart.

## Initial Design Goals
We started off brainstorming ideas for our go-kart with two main goals in mind; maximum speed and good cornering. One factor that plays a 
major role in speed is having a low center of gravity. Our design had downward welds that would lower the middle section of the kart below
the center of the wheels which effectively reduced the center of gravity. Secondly, in order to make the kart more aerodynamic, the spacing
between all the components such as the engine, seat, pedals were all optimized to make the kart as small as possible while still taking into 
consideration the comfort of the driver. We also had to stay under the budget of $1300 for the entire go-kart.

In order to ensure good cornering, we decided to implment Ackermann steering geometry to our kart. This would greatly reduce the slippage of tires 
when going around corner, which is essential as our final course consisted of a lot of sharp turns. A lot of mathematical calculations involving
the turning radius, wheelbase, wheel radius resulted in a maximum steering angle of 38Â° and an Ackermann ratio of 0.522. FEA analysis was also 
performed in order to guarantee that the chassis would not fail under the weight of the driver, engine, and other components of the kart.

## Fabrication Process
After desinigning and ensuring that our design would be feasible, we moved on to the fabrication process. For the chassis, we utilized a 24' long
metal tube and cut it up into different sections. These sections were then welded together using MIG welds. Some of the angled welds were done by
more experienced welders on the team, and it all worked out as none of the welds gave out during testing.

Then, we moved on to mounting all the parts onto the frame. We started off with the rear axle kit as we had to weld a couple of small pieces at the 
end of the car to attach its mounting brackets. Upon putting it together, we had to get rid of the third horizontal bar across the width of the kart 
as it would intefere with the sprocket of the axle. We replaced that bar with two angled cuts that went from the end of the kart to the middle of the
second bar in order to keep the same structural integrity. The mounting brackets were welded to the small pieces at the end and the rear axle along with
the wheels spun freely.

The next step was to install the engine. We wanted to
